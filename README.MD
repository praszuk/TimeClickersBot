# Python TimeClickersBot
TimeClickersBot can help you farm Time Cubes or Time Weapons.

### How it works?
It's buying *Team Members* and it's waiting until your bonus time will be end and you will get some Time Cubes. Then it makes *Time Warp* and starting over again.

This program is for players which have at least **Defender 10**  achievement unlocked. Of course it can be used without it but it can be not efficiency.

The main strategy is investing in skills: **Starting Gold** and **Abilities Duration**.
